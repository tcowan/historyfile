Readme:

These scripts were written to analyze the number of General-and-above class hams
within 500 miles of zipcode 84092 an 28778 (where Tom Witherspoon lives in North
Carolina).

Stuart K7PWS was complaining that Tom Witherspoon's videos shows him running QRP
and activating every single park yet Stuart had a lot of trouble activating parks
here in Utah.  

The graph in hamdensity.numbers shows there are 2.5 times the number of hams
near Tom Witherspoon's parks in North Carolina than near us in Utah.  I also
found from using Mariadb that it took over 2 hours to join three tables together
and less than ten seconds with SQLite3.  I had to escape all quote marks within
the CSV files for SQLite3. I did this manually with VSCode and I will write a
simple sed script to do it in the future. the ..fixed.dat files are the CSV
files with escaped quote marks.  SQLite3 does not tolerate quote marks when
importing.

The getall script downloads the latest weekly FCC callsign database and
populates fcc.db with the AM, EN, and HD records.

sql3.txt loads the zipcode files used in the scratchpad sql statements to tally
the number of hams in a radius around a zipcode.  The zipcodes loaded into
tables are downloaded from
https://www.freemaptools.com/find-zip-codes-inside-radius.htm and need to be
converted into a file with one zipcode per line.
